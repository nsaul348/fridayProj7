This is Friday project 7 for business applications development 

FP1:  This Python program creates a Mad Libs game where the player is prompted to enter specific words, which are then inserted into a pre-defined story template. The player is asked to provide various types of words such as a large object, multiple large objects, an adjective, a body part, a restaurant name, and two types of food. The game displays a message with instructions and then takes inputs for each required word. These inputs are stored in variables and later used to populate a story template. Finally, the completed story is printed with the player's inputs in the appropriate places.
