# fridayProj7
This is Friday project 7 for business applications development 

FP1:  This Python program creates a Mad Libs game where the player is prompted to enter specific words, which are then inserted into a pre-defined story template. The player is asked to provide various types of words such as a large object, multiple large objects, an adjective, a body part, a restaurant name, and two types of food. The game displays a message with instructions and then takes inputs for each required word. These inputs are stored in variables and later used to populate a story template. Finally, the completed story is printed with the player's inputs in the appropriate places.

FP2:  This Python program generates random lottery numbers for a PowerBall ticket, where five numbers are selected from 1 to 69, and one final "PowerBall" number is chosen from 1 to 26. The program first greets the user, explaining that it will generate random lottery numbers. Using the randint function from the random module, it creates five random numbers between 1 and 69 and one additional random number between 1 and 26. These numbers are stored in variables and then printed in a single line with one space between the first five numbers and three spaces before the sixth. The program ends with a farewell message to the user.
