This is Friday project 7 for business applications development 

FP1:  This Python program creates a Mad Libs game where the player is prompted to enter specific words, which are then inserted into a pre-defined story template. The player is asked to provide various types of words such as a large object, multiple large objects, an adjective, a body part, a restaurant name, and two types of food. The game displays a message with instructions and then takes inputs for each required word. These inputs are stored in variables and later used to populate a story template. Finally, the completed story is printed with the player's inputs in the appropriate places.

FP2:  This Python program generates random lottery numbers for a PowerBall ticket, where five numbers are selected from 1 to 69, and one final "PowerBall" number is chosen from 1 to 26. The program first greets the user, explaining that it will generate random lottery numbers. Using the randint function from the random module, it creates five random numbers between 1 and 69 and one additional random number between 1 and 26. These numbers are stored in variables and then printed in a single line with one space between the first five numbers and three spaces before the sixth. The program ends with a farewell message to the user.

FP3:  This Python program is a number guessing game where the computer selects a secret number between 1 and 10, and the user tries to guess it. The program starts by greeting the user and asking if they want to play the game. If the user says "no," the program ends with a farewell message. If the user says "yes," the program generates a random secret number using the randint function from the random module. The user is then prompted to guess the number repeatedly. If their guess is too low or too high, the program provides feedback; if the guess is correct, it congratulates the user and ends with a farewell message.

FP4: This Python program is a Quiz Bowl study tool that uses a dictionary of trivia questions and answers to quiz the user. The program starts with a dictionary where the keys are questions and the values are the correct answers. Using a for loop, it iterates through each question in the dictionary, displaying each question and prompting the user for their answer. After the user responds, the program checks if their answer matches the correct answer. If the answer is correct, it provides positive feedback; if not, it indicates that the answer is incorrect. The program then moves on to the next question, and the process continues until all questions are asked.

FP5:  This Python program defines five functions to change the color of text using ANSI color codes. Each function takes a string as input and returns the text formatted in a specific color, such as red, blue, green, yellow, or brown. The program allows the user to select a color and input text to display in that color. An optional feature includes a sixth function that randomly selects a color from the five defined colors. A loop is added to allow users to color multiple pieces of text in one session, with an option for custom ANSI color codes for additional color experimentation.

FP6:  This Python program simulates a simple bank account system using a class structure, allowing a user to interactively manage their balance. The program defines a BankAccount class with attributes for an account number and a balance. It includes three methods for depositing money, withdrawing money, and checking the current balance. The main program creates an instance of the BankAccount class and uses an indefinite loop to prompt the user for their account number before each interaction. The user can then choose to deposit, withdraw, or check their balance. This program provides a basic simulation of bank account operations with an option to loop until the user exits.
